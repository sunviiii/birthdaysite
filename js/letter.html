    <h2>For You 🤍</h2>

    <p>
      Pretty✨

Do you know how happy how grateful I am that I met you? I never imagined I would love you this much. When I first met you, I had no idea we would come this far, no idea that you would become my everything.

I don’t know if you still remember that day, but I do. I remember it clearly. I can still hear my baby saying she isn’t pretty! when, honestly, you are the prettiest girl I have ever seen. I know you’ll say “OA” if I say the prettiest, so fine, fine let me say this: to my eyes, you are the most beautiful girl ever. And I don’t care what anyone else thinks. Their opinions don’t matter. You are my pretty, and you will always remain the same, hehe.

Anyway, my pretty… happy birthday 🤍
I know you weren’t really looking forward to your birthday, but I was. Every night, I was counting again and again waiting for this day. You know I’m not capable of giving you a proper gift right now, and honestly… fuck this distance. Still, please adjust with this small effort I’m putting in and think of it as my gift to you. I promise, when I can, I’ll treat you with lots of candies, hehe.

Happiest birthday, baby po.
I wish I could be there for your 21st birthday. I really do. But what to do… fuck this distance again.

I hope and pray that you’re always happy. May everything be kind to you, may life be less stressful if possible, completely stress free, hehehe. May God bless you with everything you wish for, give you good health, and keep us together not just till you’re 22 or 23, but forever.

I love you so much more than anything 🤍✨
I’m endlessly grateful that you won the race and were born, because if not, I wouldn’t be feeling all of this… I wouldn’t be loving someone as deeply as I love you.

Always yours,
Sun
